    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in the United States, and
      macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom[1]—is a dish of cooked macaroni
      pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar. It can also incorporate
      other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs or meat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 large onions, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg, or to taste</li>
      <li>¾ pound shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <em>Step 1</em>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
        and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; season
        with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until
        onions are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate and discard
        the bay leaf. Reserve the skillet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 2</em>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 3</em>
        Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium
        heat. Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and
        bring to a boil; season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and
        cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in Gruyere cheese until
        melted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 4</em>
        Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce until well combined.
      </p>
