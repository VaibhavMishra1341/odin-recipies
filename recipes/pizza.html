    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
      which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
      oven.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 slices bacon</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza crust</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch seasoning, divided</li>
      <li>⅓ cup ranch dressing</li>
      <li>6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup cubed, cooked chicken</li>
      <li>⅛ cup sliced red onion</li>
      <li>1 small tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <em>Step 1</em>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 2</em>
        Cook bacon in a large skillet and over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on
        paper towels and cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 3</em>
        Pour oil into a 12-inch cast iron skillet. Brush oil all over the
        interior of the skillet. Place dough into the skillet and shape into a
        pizza, forming a crust at the edge. Prick dough all over with a fork.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Step 4</em>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven and reshape
        dough if necessary. Sprinkle the top of the dough with 2 teaspoons ranch
        seasoning. Spread ranch dressing on top.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Step 5</em>
        Sprinkle shredded mozzarella, chicken, and red onion over pizza crust.
        Crumble cooled bacon on top.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Step 6</em>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and top is browned,
        about 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Step 7</em>
        Remove pizza from oven and top with tomato slices. Melt butter and mix
        in the remaining dry ranch seasoning. Brush crust with butter-ranch
        mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Step 8</em>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Step 9</em>
        Broil pizza until cheese is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful
        not to burn.
      </p>
